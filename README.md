  ## Description

  This webpage lets users search a city and then will receive information about that city's forecast (includes date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index) and future five day forecast. The uv index will be green (favorable) when between 0 and 3 including 0, yellow (moderate) between 3 and 6 including 3, and red (severe) when 6 or higher. There is also a search history section that will include the names of the last five cities searched (no repeat) and when the user clicks the button they will be given said city's forecast and future forecast. Used [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to get weather information.
